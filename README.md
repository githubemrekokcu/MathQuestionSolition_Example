Write a program with the following components:<br>
+ determinant () function: 4 integer parameter (i, j, k, l) field and find the determinant function.<br>
+ solution () function: a function that takes two determinants (det1, det2) as a parameter and returns the solution.<br>
+ main () function: reads the coefficients a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2 and calls the above functions to print the x and y roots.<br>
